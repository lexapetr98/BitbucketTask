   * Generate a wrapper around a CodeMirror LineHandle that we can pass around and abstract the CodeMirror-ness out of.

   * in terms of line type and line number in a diff, but still reference one of those indexed lines when talking to CodeMirror.
   *
   * The lineInfos are deeply frozen so they can be passed around publicly without any danger.
   *

   * @param {string} lineType - the line type to reference (context, added, or removed)
   * @param {number} lineNumber - the line number to reference (the file to reference - source or target - depends on the lineType)
   * @param {Object} handle - an internal CodeMirror LineHandle to link to.
